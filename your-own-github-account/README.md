# Your own GitHub-account

Here you will find step by step instruction to create your own Github account.

>To be able to follow all steps in this guide, you need access to the email-address given to you by Linnaeus University. In other words you need to have a [student account](https://lnu.se/utbildning/under-studierna/it-och-support/guider/studentkonto/skapa-ett-studentkonto/). The email address is needed to verify that you are a student so that you get acces to additional resources on GitHub. 

## Step 1. Create your personal account

> If you have a GitHub-accound? Go to step 4. 

Navigate to [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join) to create a new GitHub-account. Fill in username, email, password and click __Create an account__.

> :bulb: __TIP!__ Choose a username not directly associated with your Linnaeus username. Also use a private email address so you can keep your account for private things.
